Make sure that virtualization is supported as it is required for Docker. Additionally if you are limited to less than 2GB of memory you should assign some space for [Swap](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-20-04).
{% endhint %}

* You need at least 200MB of free space for Feedbacky itself.
* Feedbacky is password-less (we use OAuth), you will need an account with at least one of these services;
  * [Discord](https://discord.com)
  * [GitHub](https://github.com)
  * [Google](https://www.google.com)
  * [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)
* In order for your users to be notified when their subscribed content is updated, you will need an SMTP server or use one of the following mail providers;

## Docker

`Size; ~330MB`

Both the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are necessary dependencies for Feedbacky.

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide</summary>

1\. Make sure that your system is up to date.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Docker requires some dependencies to be installed on your system.

```
 sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

3\. Add Docker's official GPG key.

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

4\. Use Docker's stable repository.

```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

5\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

6\. Install Docker Engine and it's related packages.

```
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

7\. Test that the Docker Engine was successfully installed.

```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

8\. Download the Docker Compose repository.

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

9\. Change the permission of downloaded Docker Compose binaries.

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

10\. Test that Docker Compose was successfully installed.&#x20;

```
docker-compose --version
```

## MariaDB

`Size; ~200MB`

MariaDB is recommended over MySQL as it brings better performance but MySQL will still work with Feedbacky if you already have it installed.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Additional configuration needed, **do not** skip this part if you already have MariaDB installed.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide</summary>

1\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Install the MariaDB server package.

```
sudo apt install -y mariadb-server
```

3\. Run and go through the security script.

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

The script will ask you to set a root password, press `N` to skip it. The root password is already tied to the system on Ubuntu and changing it could result in MariaDB breaking.

### Additional Configuration

Docker will treat your container as a remote machine, we need to change the value of `bind-address`  in order to accept non localhost connections.

4\. Edit your `50-server.cnf`.

```
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
```

5\. Change the value of `bind-address` to `0.0.0.0`.

{% code title="50-server.cnf" %}
```
bind-address            = 0.0.0.0
```
{% endcode %}

6\. Save the file with `CTRL` + `S` and exit nano with `CTRL` + `C`.

7\. Restart MariaDB.

```
sudo systemctl restart mariadb-server
```

</details>

## Webserver

A webserver is needed in order to point a domain to your instance. Any will suffice as long as they support reverse proxy.

We have a guide for both Apache and Nginx, choose the one you prefer.&#x20;

### Apache

`Size; ~10MB`

{% hint style="info" %}
Apache will require further configuration to enable reverse proxy support.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide</summary>

1\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Install the Apache package.

```
sudo apt install -y apache2
```

3\. Verify that Apache is running.

```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

</details>

### Nginx

`Size; ~2MB`

{% hint style="info" %}
Nginx supports reverse proxy out of the box.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide</summary>

1\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Install the Nginx package.

```
