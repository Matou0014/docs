# Conclusion

## ðŸŽ‰  Congratulations!

If everything went alright you completed the installation guide for self-hosting Feedbacky and should have your own instance ready.

You can reach us with one of the support links if you encountered any issue along the way.

#### By following the self-host guide you should also have learned the basics of;

* Installing Docker with Compose, MariaDB and Apache or Nginx.
* Using the `apt` package manager on Ubuntu or any other Debian-based Linux distribution.
* Configuring a MySQL user and table.
* Editing files with the `nano` editor.

## What's Next

Read our administrator's handbook to get started with your new instance.&#x20;
